XIII. Practical related Questions
1. Write a procedure to display the icons on the Toolbar Control.
 ToolBar buttons are able to display icons within them for easy identification by users. This
is achieved through adding images to the ImageList Component component and then
associating the ImageList component with the ToolBar control.
To set an icon for a toolbar button programmatically
1. In a procedure, instantiate an ImageList component and a ToolBar control.
2. In the same procedure, assign an image to the ImageList component.
3. In the same procedure, assign the ImageList control to the ToolBar control and assign
the ImageIndex property of the individual toolbar buttons.
2. Difference between Form and Panel Control in VB.NET
 Windows Forms Panel controls are used to provide an identifiable grouping for other
controls. Typically, you use panels to subdivide a form by function. The Panel control is
similar to the GroupBox control; however, only the Panel control can have scroll bars, and
only the GroupBox control displays a caption.

PictureBox3.Visible = False
ElseIf PictureBox2.Visible Then
PictureBox1.Visible = False
PictureBox2.Visible = False
PictureBox3.Visible = True
ElseIf PictureBox3.Visible Then
PictureBox1.Visible = True
PictureBox2.Visible = False
PictureBox3.Visible = False
End If
End Sub
Private Sub Form1_Load(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load
Timer1.Enabled = True
Timer1.Interval = 1600
PictureBox1.Visible = True
PictureBox2.Visible = False
PictureBox3.Visible = False
